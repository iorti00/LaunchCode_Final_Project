# LaunchCode_Final_Project
Final Project for Women+ Data Analysis cohort: Summary of Pokemon Stats


`Objective`: It’s been a while since I played pokemon competitively, and there are so many new Pokemon, stats, features, and attributes to keep track of. My objective is to streamline the user process of team building and determining what pokemon would be best suited based on stats and typing

`*.` My project is a statistical summary and visualization of a Pokémon data set that helps users determine the best overall stats by Pokémon or type. My question asks "What Pokémon have the highest stats and is best suited to creating a team? How can I present this information in a way that is clear and easy to follow for someone who is unfamiliar with the subject"

`*.` The purpose and function of the project is to streamline the process of determining what Pokémon would be best to use in a team building scenario, using Tableau as an interactive interface for selection. The information is simplified to help anyone jump right into the process. 

`*.` Some project features that it currently has is Data collection, I have found and selected what data best fits the model from Kaggle. Cleaning the data and exploratory analysis on the data sets that I used to find applicable information for the visualization process using Pandas, Python, and tools such as Jupyter Notebooks. Visualizations in Tableau to showcase a report and statistical summary of the data in a way that makes it easy for anyone to understand. 

`*.` A user would interact via the interactive Tableau story I have created. My Tableau story also has a report summary of the findings from the data, and recommendations based on what is needed to create a team in game. I have also included links to my sources and GitHub for additional information. 

`*.` Most of the data I obtain is from the site Kaggle, links for each will be provided in my GitHub. For the EDA process, data cleaning, and manipulation, I used the programming language Python along with Pandas library using Jupyter Notebooks. I also used these for visualization in the EDA and cleaning process, and for the final summary I used Tableau. To manage my project I utilized GitHub.

`*.` I really enjoyed working on the project and I see myself adding additional parameters and calculated fields to my Tableau for selecting each individual Pokémon, and additional summaries such as the abilities, move sets, and a correlation value matrix for the resistance and offensive typing. I also want to continue researching and collecting data into a compiled data base for users, sharing my cleaned data on Kaggle, and providing my GitHub for reference,
